# Junior Developer Task – June 2025

This project is a serverless API endpoint built to fulfill a technical challenge. The API receives a string via a webhook, transforms the string into an array of characters, sorts them alphabetically, and returns the result as a JSON response.

## 🧠 Objective

Create a POST API endpoint that:

- Accepts a JSON payload with a data field (string).

- Converts the string into a character array.

- Sorts the array alphabetically.

- Returns the sorted characters as a word array in JSON format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js

- Express.js

- Vercel Serverless Functions (for deployment)

- TypeScript (optional but recommended for future scalability)

## 📦 Installation
